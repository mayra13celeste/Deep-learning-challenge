# Deep-learning-challenge

he purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model to predict the success of funding applications for a charitable organization. The dataset consists of various features related to application characteristics, and the goal is to classify whether an application is successful based on these attributes. The analysis involves data preprocessing, building a neural network model, and evaluating its performance.

Results

Data Preprocessing

Target Variable:

The target variable for the model is IS_SUCCESSFUL, which indicates whether a funding application was approved.

Feature Variables:

The features selected for the model include categorical and numerical variables such as APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, INCOME_AMT, and other relevant attributes.

Removed Variables:

EIN and NAME were removed as they are identifiers and do not contribute to the prediction.

STATUS and SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS were also dropped as they were deemed non-beneficial.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

Neural Network Architecture:

The model consists of multiple layers with the following details:

Input Layer: Matches the number of features in the dataset.

Hidden Layers: Two or more layers with ReLU activation functions.

Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to perform binary classification.

Model Performance:

The target accuracy was set above 75%, but the model initially struggled to reach this level.

Optimization Steps Taken:

Different numbers of neurons and layers were tested to improve performance.

Additional feature engineering, such as binning the ASK_AMT variable, was performed.

Hyperparameter tuning, including changing activation functions and learning rates, was attempted.

Summary

The deep learning model was able to classify funding applications with reasonable accuracy, but it faced challenges in achieving the desired performance threshold.

Alternative models, such as Random Forest or XGBoost, could be explored as they might provide better interpretability and performance for structured tabular data.

Future improvements could involve further feature engineering, trying different neural network architectures, or using ensemble learning techniques to enhance predictions.
